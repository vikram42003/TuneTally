        <p>
          TuneTally is a web app that lets you explore your music listening habits. You can check your top artists,
          songs, favorite genres, and even your recently played tracks, all in one place!
        </p>

        <p>
          I built this app because I was curious about my own taste in music and wanted an easy way to see which songs
          and artists Iâ€™ve been playing the most. It started as a personal project to learn new tools and techonologies,
          and quickly grew into something I wanted to share.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project is not affiliated with Spotify. Itâ€™s just a hobby project built with React, Tailwind, AWS Lambda,
          and the Spotify API.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, this app supports only Spotify. However, it's built to be platform-agnostic, so support for Apple
          Music or YouTube Music may be added in the future.
        </p>

        <p>ðŸŽ¶ Think of it like a mini Spotify Wrapped you can access anytime!</p>
