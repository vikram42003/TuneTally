# TuneTally
TuneTally is a music listening statistics app

Whats it is -
It will fetch data from a music listening website/api and show your music listening statistics like 
- your top artists
- most listened songs
- how much more (or less) listening hours you have compared to other users
- will fetch the data securely and wont store any user credentials and will just redirect you to the actual spotify (or other) authentication pages

Whats the MVP -
just fetch your own data from spotify and print it to console or screen
then build all the other stuff on top of that

Will I use a backend -
probably not, since i dont want to save any user data for security reasons
But i might tho to just store the app related statistics like 
- how many users have used this app until now 
- how many total hours of music have been fetched and displayed by this app
- whats the average number of listening hours of this apps users
